This log file contains two types of data: significance analysis and cross-days results.

The significance analysis files provide detailed results of significance testing under the mixed-effects model. Files with the suffix '_summary' are summary files offering an overview of the significance analysis.

The cross-days results show the outcomes of different models under various conditions. Files with the suffix '_all' are summary files with better readability.
